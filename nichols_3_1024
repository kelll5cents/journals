 On thursday and friday I got some of the parts I needed and started tinkering
with them and puting some together. Monday I plan to gather the rest of the 
parts I need. Tuesday through thursday I plan to work on setting up the 
circuit and looking through the program for it. On friday I hope to finish typing the program.
